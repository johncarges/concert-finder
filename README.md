# Concert Finder

by John Carges and Nial Johnson

### Objective

With this app we are creating, we are making a space where you will be able to find concerts or events that you are interested in using the SeatGeek API. You will also be able to add events that you are interested in to a favorites section, where you can access them easier for later. We also would like to incule a feature that give us the range to search from location, day, artist ect.

# Deliverables

### 1. Connecting APIs

We want to first display the infomation that we get from the SeatGeek API. Once that is loaded, we also need to connect another API so that there is a place for our favorited events.

### 2. Creating a favorites Page
Within our page, we want to have a main page where we have the listings of concerts. From that page we want to redirect to another where it has our favorites listed

### 3. Click Actions
We should be able to click on events that we want to favorite and have them appeat in our favorites section. Within our favorites section, We would also have the ability to remove them as well.

### 4. Filtered Search
When looking for events we want to be able to search for events based on location, artist/band, venue, ect.


# Extra Deliverables

 1. Integrate Setlist.fm API: if a band is touring and has recent shows documented on setlist.fm, create list of frequently played songs.

 2. Provide external links to ticket sales

3. Share favorites: send your concert wishlist to your friends, and find concerts you want to see together!
